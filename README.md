# ProofOfConcept reagarding to Async/Await

I intent to represent and understand using charts how to work the  keys Async/await in .NET.

The idea is to define several levels of call stack among Async/No Async methods  generating series of data in order to know:

1) how many threads are working.
2) order of execution of methods involved
3) time elapsed by each method
4) etc
